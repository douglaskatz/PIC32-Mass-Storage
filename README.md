This collection of libraries is intended to make it easy to use Mass Storage Devices with the PIC32MX250F128B. USB_MSD_Base is a baseline project that has all the necessary includes and files but it is empty to allow the user to create their own project. The other projects are examples demonstrating the functionality available. For full documentation, refer to the PIC32MSDReport.pdf file included in the repository.
